# CraftBeerPi

This project is shamelessly forked from https://github.com/Manuel83/craftbeerpi

This fork is intended to add support for a few new sensors and for my custom HERMS
controller PCB.

The PCB contains
-2x MAX31865 RTD Amplifiers
-1x EzoPh Amplifier
-2x Pump/Heater Outputs
-A bunch of LEDs
-Automatic control of a 12v Power Supply
-An expansion connector because I can't think of everything
